# hello-world
First repository

My name is Marcos. I'm 27 and I'm trying to become a developer. I currently live in Ca√ßapava - Brazil and hope to be living elsewhere as soon as possible with my family. Nowadays I'm studying PHP and Databases but I already have some sort of knowledge in HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript.
